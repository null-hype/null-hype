### 0x00: The Axiom

In science, the **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)** is the default position: no effect, no relationship, no signal — until the evidence forces a different conclusion.

In security and infrastructure, **Null Hype** applies the same standard:

1. The "revolutionary" new tool is probably just noise.
2. The system is insecure by default.
3. Manual intervention is a failure of architecture.
4. If it isn't measured, it didn't happen.

This profile is not a portfolio of promises. It is a log of evidence.

### 0x01: The Work

I build automated, hermetic systems that **find what vendors miss and prove what auditors assume**.

The core offering is adversarial infrastructure research — continuous, agent-driven, evidence-producing. Not a one-time pentest. Not a compliance checkbox. A running audit of the attack surface, updated as the surface changes.

**The Cyber Farm** is the engine behind this: a self-contained, reproducible research environment that scans, verifies, and reports without requiring a human in the loop at every step.

```
Input:  A network, a product, a hypothesis.
Output: A signed, reproducible finding — or silence.
```

Silence is the rarest output.

### 0x02: The Stack

| Layer | Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | Argo Workflows, Dagger |
| **Verification** | Playwright, Terratest |
| **Configuration** | Pkl, Terraform |
| **Philosophy** | GitOps or GTFO |

Every component is reproducible. Every finding is verifiable. Every environment can be torn down and rebuilt from a single commit.

### 0x03: The Philosophy

- **Contingency over Truth** *(Rorty)* — There is no "perfect code," only code that is useful for the current vocabulary of problems. Architectures age. Threat models don't self-update. Keep both in revision.
- **Panta Rhei** *(Heraclitus)* — You cannot step into the same `main` branch twice. Everything is in flux; immutable infrastructure is the only way to survive the river.
- **Kein Hype, Nur Daten** — Results, not marketing decks. If it can't be demonstrated in a reproducible environment, it doesn't count.

### 0x04: Threat Model for This Profile

Most automated activity originating from this account is research infrastructure — high-frequency scanning, agent-driven reconnaissance, and protocol-level verification.

If you are receiving traffic from my agents:
- Consult `SECURITY.md` for responsible disclosure and scope.
- Assume it is intentional and documented.
- Do not assume it is noise.

### 0x05: Status

| Component | State | Signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cyber Farm** | `Building` | The harvest is pending. Commits are the evidence. |
| **Research** | `Active` | Auditing the obscure. |
| **Client Work** | `Selective` | APAC-based. Serious inquiries only. |
| **Location** | `APAC` | Sydney / The Grid. |

### 0x06: Engagement

Serious inquiries via commit message or signed email. If you don't know what that means, we are probably not a good fit.

$H_1$ is only accepted under the weight of evidence.
