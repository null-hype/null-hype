> Well, obviously it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.

## 0x00: The Axiom

In science, the **Null Hypothesis (*H*₀)** assumes there is no relationship
between variables until significant evidence proves otherwise.

In software, **Null Hype** assumes:

1. The "revolutionary" new tool is likely just noise.
2. The system is insecure by default.
3. Manual intervention is a failure of architecture.

This profile is not a portfolio of promises; it is a log of evidence.

## 0x01: The Infrastructure (The Cyber Farm)

I am currently architecting an automated, hermetic research environment
designed to audit the void.

* **Orchestration:** Argo Workflows, Dagger
* **Verification:** Playwright, Terratest
* **Configuration:** Pkl, Terraform
* **Philosophy:** GitOps or GTFO.

Most activity here involves high-frequency automated network scanning and
vulnerability research. If you are seeing traffic from my agents, consult
`SECURITY.md`.

## 0x02: The Philosophy

* **Contingency over Truth:** (Rorty) There is no "perfect code," only code
  that is useful for the current vocabulary of problems.
* **Panta Rhei:** (Heraclitus) You cannot step into the same `main` branch
  twice. Everything is in flux; immutable infrastructure is the only way to
  survive the river.
* **Kein Hype, Nur Daten:** (German) We speak in results, not marketing decks.
